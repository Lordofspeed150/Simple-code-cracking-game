PLEASE DO NOT read ahead of this message if you want a challenge without explanation of the puzzle.<br />   


In this game you are given 4 rows of numbers. the first row consists of that I call primary numbers.<br />   
Primary numbers are multiplied by the numbers below them. Let me give an example:<br />   

3 | 8 | 4 | 9<br />   
0 | 1 | 1 | 1<br />   
0 | 0 | 1 | 1<br />   
0 | 0 | 0 | 0<br />   

we have our first number, 3. since all the numbers below it are 0, it is multiplied by 0.<br />   
in our second column we have 8, the numbers below is are 1, 0 and 0. therefore 8 is multiplied by 1.<br />   
in our third column there is a 4 are two 1's below it. hence, 4 * (1+1) = 8.<br />   
lastly, in our 4th column we got 9 and two 2's below it, we do the same as previously. 9 * (1+1) = 18.<br />   
* we do not write anything for a column if it's answer is 0.<br />   

our answer should be 8818.<br />   
(0)  8   8   18<br />   
1st 2nd 3rd  4th
